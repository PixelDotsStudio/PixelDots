        <h1>Our Privacy Commitment</h1>

        <p>Pixel Dots Studios (hereinafter referred to as "Pixel Dots," "we," or "our"), located in Hong Kong, is a
            developer and publisher of mobile device games. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your
            personal information by adopting industry-recognized security measures to prevent data loss, misuse, or
            alteration in our systems. This Privacy Policy is intended to describe how we collect, protect, maintain,
            and share personal information of users and visitors when such information is collected on our website or
            applications.</p>

        <h2>Scope of the Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>This Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information collected
            when you access the Pixel Dots website ("Website"), when you order, download, and/or use our games and
            mobile applications ("Applications"), and any information shared by Pixel Dots' business partners with Pixel
            Dots ("Services").</p>

        <p>Our Services may contain links or portions of content linking to other websites or services. When you leave
            our Services or view portions of content from third-party websites or services through our Services, we
            recommend that you read the privacy policies of those websites or third-party services. Pixel Dots is not
            responsible for the privacy practices or content of other websites or services.</p>

        <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using our Services. If you do not wish for Pixel Dots to
            collect, use, store, or disclose your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, you may not
            use our Website or applications.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <p>Pixel Dots collects different types of information from you to provide the best products and user experience
            and to operate effectively. Some information is provided directly by you, while some may be collected
            automatically, especially by observing how you interact with our services. In general, we may receive your
            personal information in the following ways:</p>

        <h3>Information Provided Directly by You</h3>

        <p>When you register for our sponsored events, complete forms requesting information, submit support queries,
            contact us for employment inquiries, or participate in our sponsored blogs and online communities, we
            receive information from you to facilitate your requests.</p>

        <h3>Information Provided by Third Parties when Downloading Applications</h3>

        <p>When you download applications, we may access certain information based on the permissions granted by the
            application store provider (such as the Apple App Store or Google Play). Generally, this information is
            related to orders and includes order numbers, purchased games, and other relevant information. When
            necessary, the application store provider may allow us to access certain additional information related to
            orders to respond to support queries. Typically, this is limited to the email address you have provided to
            us so we can respond to your support requests. By using third-party social networks (such as Facebook or
            Game Center) to access services or by other means when personal information is necessary for your use and/or
            participation, your personal information may also be provided to Pixel Dots. Please note that by using Pixel
            Dots applications via third-party social networks or other third-party platforms or services ("Third-Party
            Social Networks"), or by connecting to Third-Party Social Networks through applications, you authorize us to
            collect, store, and use any and all information as described in this Privacy Policy, and you agree that the
            Third-Party Social Networks may provide us with information based on the settings or preferences available
            to you on those Third-Party Social Networks.</p>

        <h3>Indirectly Provided Information</h3>

        <p>When you use our Services, we also collect information indirectly from you. We may collect information
            automatically through the Services, which may include your IP address, device type, unique device
            identifiers, browser type, general geographic location (such as country or city-level location), device
            serial number or MAC address, open device identifiers (UDID), and other related technical information. We
            may also collect information about how your device interacts with our website, including pages visited and
            links clicked. Collecting this information allows us to better understand visitors to our website, where
            they come from, and which content on our website interests them. We use this information for internal
            analytical purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our website to our visitors.</p>

        <p>When using our applications, our servers may automatically record certain information related to your use of
            the application, such as links and advertisements clicked on our mobile applications, times of interaction
            with the application, and other statistical information. We aggregate this information to analyze all
            application users and use this information to manage our applications, expand features based on our users'
            needs and preferences, and improve the functionality of the applications.</p>

        <p>When using our Services, certain information may also be collected using cookies and similar tracking
            technologies, as described in our Cookie Policy.</p>

        <p>We also receive your personal information from our analytics and advertising partners, as outlined in this
            Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Personal Information</h2>

        <p>We do not sell, rent, lease, trade, or share your personal information with any third party unless described
            in this Privacy Policy. The primary purpose of collecting information from you is to provide you with the
            services you request. Your personal information will not be shared with third parties unaffiliated with
            Pixel Dots unless we obtain your explicit permission or unless we have other legal obligations.</p>

        <p>Personal information of application users, such as names, contact information, usernames, and passwords, is
            stored by our third-party market partners (such as Apple and Google). Any information we share is secure and
            used only to assist you in accessing your account according to agreements with the relevant third-party
            market partners. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share this information outside of
            Pixel Dots. We may share information about your use of our applications with trusted third parties to enable
            us to improve features and/or services requested by you.</p>

        <h2>Analytics Metrics and Other Technologies</h2>

        <p>Our services may include third-party tracking tools from our service providers, such as Google Analytics.
            These third parties may use cookies, APIs, and/or SDKs in our services to collect and analyze user
            information on our behalf. Third parties may have access to information such as your device identifiers, MAC
            addresses, IMEIs, language settings (specific locations for specific languages), geographic location
            information, and IP addresses. We use analytics information to support business analysis and operations,
            business intelligence, product development, improvement of products and services, personalized content,
            advertising, and recommendations. These third-party tracking tools may also use a technology called
            conversion tracking. We use conversion tracking to assess the quality of advertising campaigns we are
            running to promote Pixel Dots products. For example, you may see our mobile applications advertised in other
            services. Clicking on these advertisements and installing our applications allows us to verify installations
            and share device identifiers with applicable third-party advertisers. You can view a non-exclusive list of
            analytics companies operating through these technologies in our applications by
